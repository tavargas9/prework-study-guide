# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created to help me (a bootcamp student) and others like me who are going through the prework. It is also used as a reference for students to look back on in the future if they forget or get stuck on one of these topics throughout their time in the bootcamp. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.
